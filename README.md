Some of my notes as I learn go

Here's a handy table

| Lesson | Description |
| ------ | ----------  |
| [Lesson A: Modules, Packanges and intro](/notes/A_Packages.md) | An introduction to the concepts of modules and packages in Go.It explains how to initialize a new module using the go mod init command, create and identify packages, and includes example code demonstrating the use of the fmt package for printing to the console. The document also covers Go's convention of using tabs for indentation, and provides instructions for running and building Go programs, including cross-compilation for different operating systems and architectures. |
| [Constants, Variables and Data Types](/notes/B_vars_and_primitive_types.md) | "Constants, Variables and Data Types" provides an overview of how to declare and assign values to variables in Go, using the var keyword for variable declarations and := for short variable declarations within functions. It explains basic data types, including integers, unsigned integers, floats, strings, runes, and booleans, along with their default values and arithmetic operations. The importance of using constants for values that do not change is highlighted, utilizing the const keyword. Additionally, the document discusses type inference, type conversion, and the differences between Go's handling of strings and runes compared to other languages.  |
